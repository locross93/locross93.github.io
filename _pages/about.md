I am a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University in the Department of Computer Science under the joint supervision of Prof. Dan Yamins and Prof. Nick Haber. My research combines interdisciplinary approaches to understand how intelligence emerges in humans and can be built in machines. This work is centered on modeling complex decision-making processes in dynamic, naturalistic tasks with cutting-edge deep learning tools, including deep reinforcement learning and large language model based agents. Currently, I am investigating how to endow artificial agents with theory of mind and social cognitive processes such that they can predict and interact with other agents in multi-agent/social domains. I received my Bachelor’s in Neuroscience at University of Southern California and completed my PhD in Computation and Neural Systems at Caltech with John O’Doherty.
