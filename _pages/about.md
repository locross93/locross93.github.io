I am a PhD student in Computation and Neural Systems at Caltech, and a member of John O'Doherty's lab. I am broadly interested in the study of intelligence and learning in humans, animals, and machines. My work combines approaches and insights from a variety of disciplines, including computational neuroscience, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and economics.
